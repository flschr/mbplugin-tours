Sometimes the best rides are the unplanned ones. Started with a vague idea of exploring some gravel roads I'd seen on the map, ended up with a fantastic day of riding and several excellent coffee stops.

The route took me through quiet farm roads, forest tracks, and some surprisingly technical gravel sections. Weather was perfect - cool morning air, warming up to a pleasant 18°C by afternoon.

## The Coffee Stops

Because a good gravel ride needs good coffee:

1. **Café Alpenblick** (km 15): Excellent espresso, friendly owner who's also a cyclist
2. **Bakery in Lenggries** (km 42): Fresh pretzels and cappuccino
3. **Mountain hut** (km 58): Simple but perfect coffee with a view

## Route Notes

The gravel was in great condition - mostly hard-packed with some loose sections after recent forestry work. A few short road sections connected the gravel segments. Very little traffic on the farm roads.

**Bike**: Specialized Diverge with 42mm tires
**Gearing**: 1x with 40T chainring - perfect for this terrain
**Avg Speed**: 18 km/h (including coffee stops!)

Already planning the next variant of this route. There are so many good gravel roads around here waiting to be explored.
