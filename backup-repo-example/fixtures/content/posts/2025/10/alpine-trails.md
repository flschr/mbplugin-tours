Perfect autumn riding conditions today! The trails were dry, the leaves were golden, and the temperature was just right for some technical mountain biking.

This is one of my favorite MTB routes in the area - a perfect mix of flow trails, technical sections, and stunning views. The climb is tough but manageable, and the descent is absolutely worth it.

## Highlights

- **Flow Trail Section**: About 3km of perfectly maintained single trail with berms and jumps
- **Technical Climb**: Rocky switchbacks that test your skills
- **Panorama Point**: 360° views of the Karwendel range at the highest point

## Trail Conditions

- Dry and dusty in exposed sections
- Some loose rocks on the steep parts
- A few muddy spots in the forest sections

## Bike Setup

- **Bike**: Canyon Spectral CF 8
- **Tires**: Schwalbe Magic Mary front, Hans Dampf rear
- **Suspension**: 150mm front, 140mm rear
- **Dropped**: 0 chains (finally!)

The bike handled everything perfectly. I've been really happy with the Spectral's versatility - climbs well enough but really shines on the descents.

Next time I want to try the alternative descent via the old logging road, which is supposed to be even faster.
