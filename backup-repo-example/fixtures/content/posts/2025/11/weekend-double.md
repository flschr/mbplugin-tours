What a weekend! Managed to squeeze in two completely different adventures - a morning trail run on Saturday and a proper mountain hike on Sunday.

## Saturday: Trail Running

Woke up early with energy to burn, so I headed out for a trail run in the local hills. Nothing too ambitious, just a fast-paced tour to get the legs moving.

The trails were in perfect condition - just enough leaves to be cushioned, not enough to be slippery. Managed a decent pace and felt great afterwards. Trail running really is the best way to explore while getting a solid workout.

## Sunday: Proper Mountain Hike

Sunday called for something more substantial. Drove up to the mountains for a classic ridge hike with spectacular views.

Started late morning and took my time. The ridge offered continuous views in all directions - you could see the Zugspitze to the west and the Großglockner to the south. Stopped for a long lunch break at the summit hut (which was still open, surprisingly).
