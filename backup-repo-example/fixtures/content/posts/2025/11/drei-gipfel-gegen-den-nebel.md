Today I conquered three peaks in the Bavarian Prealps on a foggy autumn morning. The forecast wasn't promising, but I decided to go anyway, hoping the fog would lift. And it did! By noon, I was standing above the clouds with spectacular views of the Alps.

The trail started in thick fog, making navigation a bit challenging. I relied heavily on my GPS track and marked trails. Around 500 meters elevation, I broke through the fog layer into brilliant sunshine. The contrast was stunning - looking down at a sea of clouds while the peaks around me were bathed in golden light.

## The Route

Starting from the valley, the trail led through mixed forest before opening up to alpine meadows. The three peaks - Hoher Fricken (1,940m), Karkopf (1,738m), and Brünnstein (1,619m) - offered different perspectives of the surrounding mountain ranges.

The descent was equally beautiful, dropping back into the fog layer which had thinned considerably by late afternoon.

## Gear Notes

- **Shoes**: La Sportiva Ultra Raptor II
- **Layers**: Started with rain shell, stripped down to base layer at the summit
- **Navigation**: Garmin Fenix 7 with GPX track
- **Packed**: Emergency blanket, first aid kit, extra food

Would definitely recommend this tour for anyone looking for a solid day hike with rewarding views. Best time is probably late spring through autumn. In winter, crampons and experience would be necessary.
