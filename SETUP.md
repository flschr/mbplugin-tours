# Quick Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the fischr Tours plugin for Micro.blog.

## Part 1: Plugin Installation

### 1.1 Install Plugin on Micro.blog

1. Go to Micro.blog **Settings** → **Plugins**
2. Add repository: `https://github.com/flschr/mbplugin-fischr-tours`
3. Click **Install**

### 1.2 Download Leaflet Libraries

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The plugin requires Leaflet libraries for maps to work.

From your local clone of this repo, run:

```bash
cd static/tours
curl -o leaflet.css https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css
curl -o leaflet.js https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js
curl -o leaflet-gpx.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/leaflet-gpx@1.7.0/gpx.min.js
```

Commit and push these files to the plugin repo.

### 1.3 Create Tours Page

1. In Micro.blog: **Posts** → **Pages** → **New Page**
2. Title: "Tours"
3. URL: `/tours/`
4. Layout: `tours` (set in page settings/frontmatter)
5. Optional: Add description text in the page content
6. Publish

## Part 2: Backup Repo Automation

### 2.1 Copy Required Files

Copy from this plugin repo to your Micro.blog backup repo:

```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   └── build-tours.yml
└── scripts/
    └── parse-tours.js
```

### 2.2 Configure Secrets

**Generate SSH deploy key:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "tours-actions" -f tours-key -N ""
```

**Add to plugin repo** (Settings → Deploy keys):
- Title: "GitHub Actions Tours"
- Key: Contents of `tours-key.pub`
- ✅ Allow write access

**Add to backup repo** (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
- Name: `PLUGIN_DEPLOY_KEY`
- Value: Contents of `tours-key` (private key)

### 2.3 Edit Workflow Configuration

In your backup repo, edit `.github/workflows/build-tours.yml`:

```yaml
# TODO: Update these values
env:
  BLOG_BASE_URL: "https://YOUR-BLOG.org"      # Your blog URL
  PLUGIN_REPO: "YOUR-USERNAME/mbplugin-fischr-tours"  # Plugin repo
  CONTENT_DIR: "./content/posts"              # Where your posts are
```

### 2.4 Test the Workflow

1. Go to backup repo → **Actions** tab
2. Select "Build Tours Data"
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Verify it completes successfully
5. Check plugin repo's `data/tours.json` was updated

## Part 3: Create Your First Tour

### 3.1 Upload GPX File

Upload your GPX file to Micro.blog:
- **Posts** → **Uploads** → upload GPX file
- Note the path: `/uploads/YYYY/filename.gpx`

### 3.2 Write Post with Tour Shortcode

```markdown
---
title: "My Mountain Hike"
date: 2025-11-12
---

Today's hike was amazing!

{{< tour
  id="my-first-tour"
  title="My Mountain Hike"
  date="2025-11-12"
  type="hike"
  region="Alps"
  distance_km="10.5"
  elevation_m="850"
  duration_h="4.5"
  gpx="/uploads/2025/my-hike.gpx"
>}}

The views from the summit were incredible...
```

### 3.3 Publish and Wait

1. Publish the post
2. Wait for next scheduled workflow run (4 AM UTC daily)
   - Or manually trigger it via Actions tab
3. Check `/tours/` page on your blog
4. Your tour should appear with a map!

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Plugin installed on Micro.blog
- [ ] Leaflet libraries downloaded and committed
- [ ] Tours page created at `/tours/`

- [ ] Workflow environment variables updated
- [ ] Test workflow run completed successfully
- [ ] First tour post published
- [ ] Tour appears on blog post with map
- [ ] Tour appears on `/tours/` page

## Troubleshooting

### Maps not showing
→ Check that Leaflet libraries were downloaded (see 1.2)

### Tours page shows "No tours yet"
→ Run workflow manually to generate tours.json

### Workflow fails with "Permission denied"
→ Verify deploy key has write access enabled

### Parser finds no tours
→ Check `CONTENT_DIR` path in workflow matches your repo structure
